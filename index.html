                On a day no different from any other, a straight-A university student Kim Hyun-soo (Kim Soo-hyun) makes
                the mistake of his life. Just as any other college kid would, Hyun-soo is on his way to hang out with

                university student to becoming the prime suspect in a violent murder case. While Hyun-soo shivers from
                fear and the fact that he is falsely accused, everyone still points to him as the only possible
                murderer. In this hopeless situation, those who stretch out a helping hand are a low-life attorney, Shin
                Joong-han (Cha Seung-won), and a criminal kingpin who rules the prison food chain, Do Ji-tae (Kim
                Sung-kyu). To prove his innocence in any way possible, Hyun-soo gives everything he has to fight against
                the police and the Korean prosecution.

                South Korean television series created by Hwang Dong-hyuk for Netflix. Its cast includes Lee Jung-jae,
                Park Hae-soo, Wi Ha-joon, HoYeon Jung, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi and Kim Joo-ryoung.
                <br>
                <br>
                The series revolves around a secret contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial
                hardship, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games for the chance to win a ₩45.6
                billion prize. The series' title draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang conceived
                the idea based on his own economic struggles, as well as the class disparity in South Korea and
                capitalism. Though he wrote the story in 2009, Hwang could not find a production company to fund the
                idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of a drive to expand their foreign programming
                offerings.
